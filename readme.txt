== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the status of this plugin ? =

I plan to update this plugin in the future as I still have old e107 sites to migrate. As long as I have these migrations to do, I will not officially declare my plugin dead and
unmaintained. But this future can be quite distant as I currently have much higher priority work to do.

= Can I update the plugin ? =

That's nice from you to propose to update it. All contributions are welcome ! I'll be happy to apply all your patches in the original code to let anyone benefits your work.

= How can I contribute code ? =

Feel free to send me patches and code by mail. Or better yet, use GitHub fork/merge requests.

= Where can I find the source code ? =

Development of this plugin happened in a dedicated GitHub repository: http://github.com/kdeldycke/e107-importer
