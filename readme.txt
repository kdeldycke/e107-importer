== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the import process fail, or do not end well ? =

While importing content from e107, you may encounter one of the following error:

* *Internal Server Error*
* *MySQL has gone away*
* *PHP Fatal error: Maximum execution time exceeded*

These means that the script has failed one way or another.

Generally, this is due constraints set by your hosting provider, limiting the execution time of PHP scripts. This issue affect all scripts consuming lots of CPU and memory resources, like all import scripts.

The issue and [solutions are detailed in WordPress FAQ](http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Working_with_WordPress#How_do_I_Import_a_WordPress_WXR_file_when_it_says_it_is_too_large_to_import.3F), please read this article before complaining to me.

= Why accents in my imported content are replaced by strange characters ? =

Looks like you have some kind of Unicode transcoding errors. Before running e107 Importer, your e107 site must be fully encoded in UTF-8. If it's not the case, please have a look at the [*Upgrading database content to UTF-8*](http://wiki.e107.org/?title=Upgrading_database_content_to_UTF8) article on e107 wiki.

= Can you add import of e107 forums to BuddyPress and bbPress ? =

This plugin currently import forums to bbPress. But [the WordPress plugin version](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bbpress/), not [the standalone version](http://bbpress.org/). I also don't plan to support [BuddyPress](http://buddypress.org/) forums. I'm only interested in the bbPress plugin as it currently has features I'm interested in.

I'm still happy to add support of the two others if you have code to contribute.

= Why profanities show up in imported content ? =

This plugin ignore the configuration of the profanity filter from e107. If you want to hide words, it should be done by a dedicated WordPress plug-in. As [suggested by Jon Freger](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/11/wordpress-to-e107-v06-better-content-rendering-and-extended-news-support/#comment-2937), you can use the [WebPurify plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/webpurifytextreplace).

= Why links generated by e107's Linkwords plugin are not preserved ? =

This plugin disable all extra HTML rendering hooks added by e107 plugins. Which means Linkwords plugin will be ignored while rendering imported content. So as for profanities (see above), you have to use a third-party WordPress plugin to apply Linkwords-like transformations to your imported content.

= What is the status of this plugin ? =

I plan to update this plugin in the future as I still have old e107 sites to migrate. As long as I have these migrations to do, I will not officially declare my plugin dead and unmaintained. But this future can be quite distant as I currently have much higher priority work to do.

= Can I give you money to fix my problem ? =

That's nice from you to propose a donation but quite frankly, money is not the kind of incentives that will push the development of my plugins. But code, bug reports and testing is the kind of contributions I'm looking for. In fact getting rid of my old e107 instances is the best motivator I have. But by popular demand, here is my [donation link](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=XEXREDEHXSQUJ) anyway...

= Where can I report bugs ? =

Bug reports and feature requests must be done via [GitHub's ticket system](http://github.com/kdeldycke/e107-importer/issues).

= Can I update the plugin ? =

That's nice from you to propose to update it. All contributions are welcome ! I'll be happy to apply all your patches in the original code to let anyone benefits your work. Even after I will declare this plugin dead.

= How can I contribute code ? =

Feel free to send me patches and code by mail. Or better yet, use GitHub fork/merge features.

= Where can I find the source code ? =

Development of this plugin happen in a [dedicated GitHub repository](http://github.com/kdeldycke/e107-importer). The latter is the official repository of this plugin. All developments are done there. This repository is the reference repository.

FYI, this plugin is [also hosted on WordPress plugins' Subversion](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/e107-importer), but this repository is just a copy of GitHub's. **No original development should be performed in the Subversion repository**: changes made there will be ignored and deleted if not mirrored in the GitHub repository.
